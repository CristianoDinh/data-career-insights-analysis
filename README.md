## 4. Procedure / Analysis Methods

### A. Data Preprocessing

Before performing the analysis, the data was cleaned and transformed through the following steps:

1.  Removed empty columns
2.  Split multi-value fields using  **Text to Columns**
3.  Converted salary ranges into **average annual salary values**

### B. Advanced Analysis

The project applied three advanced algorithms and analytical methods to uncover in-depth insights.

| Method                        | Application                                          | Purpose                                         |
| :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **K-Means Clustering**        | Grouped job roles by salary and programming language | Identified role-based salary clusters           |
| **Apriori Association Rules** | Linked industries, roles, and languages              | Found meaningful relationships                  |
| **Linear Regression**         | Modeled satisfaction vs. salary and role             | Evaluated key factors influencing job happiness |


## 5. Key Findings

The project applied three advanced analytical methods and algorithms to uncover deeper insights:

### A. Roles & Salary

*   **Data Analysts** v√† **Data Scientists** dominate the market.
*   **ML Engineers** earn the highest salaries, followed by **Data Engineers**.
*   The **Tech industry** leads in pay levels.
*   Cluster 2 (via K-Means) had the highest average salaries and widest ranges.

### B. Programming Skills

*   **Python** remains the most popular language.
*   **SQL** ranks second, essential for data querying.
*   **R** remains strong in statistics and academic.

### C. Job Satisfaction & Challenges

*   **Work-life balance** received the highest satisfaction ratings.
*   **Upward Mobility** scored lowest, indicating limited career growth paths.
*   Breaking into data is seen as **moderately to highly difficult.**
*   **Salary and benefits** are the top priorities when seeking new jobs.
  
### D. Regression Results

*   Positive and statistically significant link between **salary** and **job satisfaction.**
*   **Current role** also has a strong effect on satisfaction levels.

## 6. Strategic Recommendations
